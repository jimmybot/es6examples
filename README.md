Short examples explaining JS ES6 features

For understanding generators, check out:
- generators_for_efficient_iteration.js
- generators_for_thread_control.js

For understanding ES6 classes and decorators, check out:
- UnitTest and GrueTest, which inherits from UnitTest
- LinkedList

LinkedList.js also shows a good case for creating your own iterator
