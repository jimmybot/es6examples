Short examples explaining JS ES6 features

For understanding generators, check out:
- [generators_for_efficient_iteration.js]
- [generators_for_thread_control.js]

For understanding ES6 classes and decorators, check out:
- [UnitTest](UnitTest.js) and [GrueTest](GrueTest.js), which inherits from UnitTest
- [LinkedList](LinkedList.js)

LinkedList also shows a good case for creating your own iterator
